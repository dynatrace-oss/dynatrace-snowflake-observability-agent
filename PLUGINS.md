## The Active Queries plugin
This plugin lists currently running queries and tracks the status of queries that have finished since the last check.
It reports finding from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY()` function.

Provides details on compilation and running (until now) time of the currently running query or recently finished ones.

By default information on all queries is reported as logs and metrics.

Active queries can be reported in two different modes:

* Fast mode - only reports currently active queries. Chosen with `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.FAST_MODE` set to `true`.
* Normal mode - reports queries with start timestamp up to 15 minutes from the current time. Chosen with `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.FAST_MODE` set to `false`.

Additionally, you can decide to monitor details for queries only with selected execution status, by using the `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS` configuration parameter; by default: no additional filters are applied with `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS` set to empty (`[]`).
Multiple statuses can be chosen (for example: `["RUNNING", "QUEUED"]`). This filtering will be applied on top of the chosen mode.

> **HINT:** Please note that Snowflake's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY()` function can return up to 10000 most recent queries. Therefore, if you decide to monitor queries other than just those currently `RUNNING` or being `QUEUED`, on a heavily loaded Snowflake account, there might be more than 10000 queries reported within the default 10-min interval between executing the `active_queries` plugin. Hence, if you see that the following query returns 10000 at any point, you may want to adjust the schedule of the `active_queries` plugin to avoid data loss.

```dql
fetch logs
| filter db.system == "snowflake"
| filter dsoa.run.context == "active_queries"
| filter deployment.environment == "YOUR_ENV"
| sort timestamp asc
| summarize {
  timestamp = takeFirst(timestamp),
  start = takeFirst(timestamp),
  end = takeLast(timestamp),
  timeframe = timeframe(from: takeFirst(timestamp), to:takeLast(timestamp)),
  count = count()
}, by: {
  dsoa.run.id
}
```

### Active Queries default configuration

To disable this plugin, set `IS_DISABLED` to `true`.

In case the global property `PLUGINS.DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT` is set to `true`, you need to explicitly set `IS_ENABLED` to `true` to enable selected plugins; `IS_DISABLED` is not checked then.

```json
{
    "PLUGINS": {
        "ACTIVE_QUERIES": {
            "SCHEDULE": "USING CRON */6 * * * * UTC",
            "IS_DISABLED": false,
            "FAST_MODE": true,
            "REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS": []
        }
    }
}
```

> **IMPORTANT**: For the `query_history` and `active_queries` plugins to report telemetry for all queries, the `DTAGENT_VIEWER` role must be granted `MONITOR` privileges on all warehouses.  
> This is ensured by default through the periodic execution of the `APP.P_MONITOR_WAREHOUSES()` procedure, triggered by the `APP.TASK_DTAGENT_QUERY_HISTORY_GRANTS` task.  
> The schedule for this special task can be configured using the `PLUGINS.QUERY_HISTORY.SCHEDULE_GRANTS` configuration option.  
> Since this procedure runs with the elevated privileges of the `DTAGENT_ADMIN` role, you may choose to disable it and manually ensure that the `DTAGENT_VIEWER` role is granted the appropriate `MONITOR` rights.

<a name="budgets_info_sec"></a>

## The Budgets plugin
This plugin enables monitoring of Snowflake budgets, resources linked to them, and their expenditures. It sets up and manages the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent's own budget.

All budgets within the account are reported on as logs and metrics; this includes their details, spending limit, and recent expenditures.
The plugin runs once a day and excludes already reported expenditures.

```

<a name="data_volume_info_sec"></a>

## The Data Volume plugin
This plugin enables tracking the volume of data (in bytes and rows) stored in Snowflake through reported metrics.
Additionally, it sends events when there are changes in table structure (DDL) or content.

The following information is reported:

* table type,
* timestamp of the last data update and the time elapsed since then,
* timestamp of the last DDL and the time elapsed since then,
* number of bytes in the table, and
* number of rows in the table.

}
```

<a name="dynamic_tables_info_sec"></a>

## The Dynamic Tables plugin
This plugin enables tracking availability and performance of running Snowflake dynamic table refreshes, via logs and a set of metrics.
Additionally, there are events sent when dynamic tables refresh tasks are executed.

The telemetry is based on checking 3 functions:

* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLES()`,
* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY()`, and
* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_GRAPH_HISTORY()`.

[Show semantics for this plugin](SEMANTICS.md#dynamic_tables_semantics_sec)

### Dynamic Tables default configuration

To disable this plugin, set `IS_DISABLED` to `true`.

In case the global property `PLUGINS.DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT` is set to `true`, you need to explicitly set `IS_ENABLED` to `true` to enable selected plugins; `IS_DISABLED` is not checked then.

            "IS_DISABLED": false
        }
    }
}
```

> **IMPORTANT**: For this plugin to function correctly, `MONITOR on DYNAMIC TABLES` must be granted to the `DTAGENT_VIEWER` role.  
> By default, this is handled by the `P_GRANT_MONITOR_DYNAMIC_TABLES()` procedure, which is executed with the elevated privileges of the `DTAGENT_ADMIN` role, via the `APP.TASK_DTAGENT_DYNAMIC_TABLES_GRANTS` task.  
> The schedule for this task can be configured separately using the `PLUGINS.DYNAMIC_TABLES.SCHEDULE_GRANTS` configuration option.  
> Alternatively, you may choose to disable this special task and manually ensure that the `DTAGENT_VIEWER` role is granted the necessary `MONITOR` rights.

<a name="event_log_info_sec"></a>

## The Event Log plugin
This plugin delivers to Dynatrace data reported by Snowflake Trail in the `EVENT TABLE`.

By default, it runs every 30 minutes and registers entries from the last 12 hours, omitting the ones, which:

* where already delivered,
* with scope set to `DTAGENT_OTLP` as they are internal log recording entries sent over the OpenTelemetry protocol
* related to execution of other instances of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, or
* with importance below the level set as `CORE.LOG_LEVEL`, i.e., only warnings or errors from the given Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instance are reported.

By default, it produces log entries containing the following information:

* timestamp of the entry to Snowflake Trail,
* timestamp the plugin observed the entry,
* content,
* type of record, and
* trace of the entry.

Metric entries (`RECORD_TYPE = 'METRIC'`) are sent via Dynatrace Metrics API v2.
Metrics that were identified during development time will have their semantics included already in the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent semantic dictionary; semantics for any new metric will be copied from information provided by Snowflake Trail.

Span entries (`RECORD_TYPE = 'SPAN'`) are send via OpenTelemetry Trace API, with trace ID and span ID set as reported by Snowflake Trail.

Unless [OpenTelemetry-compliant attribute names](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/), such as `code.function`, are reported in the event log table, Snowflake prefixes all internal telemetry names with `snow.`. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent passes all telemetry under the original names provided by Snowflake in the event log table. The only exception is the `SCOPE` column, where attribute names are short (like `name`) and Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent reports them with `snowflake.event.scope.` prefix, e.g., `snowflake.event.scope.name`.

### Event Log default configuration

To disable this plugin, set `IS_DISABLED` to `true`.

In case the global property `PLUGINS.DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT` is set to `true`, you need to explicitly set `IS_ENABLED` to `true` to enable selected plugins; `IS_DISABLED` is not checked then.

            "SCHEDULE_CLEANUP": "USING CRON 0 * * * * UTC",
            "IS_DISABLED": false
        }
    }
}
```

> **IMPORTANT**: A dedicated cleanup task, `APP.TASK_DTAGENT_EVENT_LOG_CLEANUP`, ensures that the `EVENT_LOG` table contains only data no older than the duration you define with the `PLUGINS.EVENT_LOG.RETENTION_HOURS` configuration option.  
> You can schedule this task separately using the `PLUGINS.EVENT_LOG.SCHEDULE_CLEANUP` configuration option, run the cleanup procedure `APP.P_CLEANUP_EVENT_LOG()` manually, or manage the retention of data in the `EVENT_LOG` table yourself.

> **INFO**: The `EVENT_LOG` table cleanup process works only if this specific instance of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent set up the table.

<a name="event_usage_info_sec"></a>

## The Event Usage plugin
This plugin delivers information regarding the history of data loaded into Snowflake event tables. It reports telemetry from the `EVENT_USAGE_HISTORY` view.

Log entries include include:

* timestamps: start and end time of the event,
* bytes ingested during the event (also reported as `snowflake.data.ingested` metric),
* credits consumed during the event (also reported as `snowflake.credits.used` metric).

    }
}
```

<a name="login_history_info_sec"></a>

## The Login History plugin
Provides detail about logins history as well as sessions history in form of logs.
The log entries include information on:

* users id who is regarded by the log,
* potential error codes,
* type of Snowflake connection,
* timestamp of logging in,
* environment the client used during the session,
* timestamp of the start of the session,
* timestamp of the end of the session,
* reason of ending the session, and
* version used by the client.

Additionally, when login error is reported, a `CUSTOM_ALERT` event is sent.

    }
}
```

<a name="query_history_info_sec"></a>

## The Query History plugin
This plugin provides information on what SQL queries were run, by whom, when, and their performance. This information is extracted from the `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` view, combined with details such as related objects or estimated costs from `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY`. For the slowest queries, additional information is retrieved from the `QUERY_OPERATOR_STATS` and `SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION` functions.

By default, this plugin executes every 30 minutes and analyzes queries that finished within the last 2 hours and have not already been processed.

Among the information it provides are:

* the IDs of processed queries,
* runtimes of processed queries,
* numbers of credits used by processed queries,
* number of bytes scanned during the completion of a query, and
* number of partitions scanned during the completion of a query.

Each query execution is reported as a log line and span, with a hierarchy of spans made from the relation to parent queries. If the query profile was retrieved with `QUERY_OPERATOR_STATS`, it is delivered as span events and additional log lines. This plugin also delivers many metrics based on telemetry information provided by Snowflake.

### Query History default configuration

To disable this plugin, set `IS_DISABLED` to `true`.

In case the global property `PLUGINS.DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT` is set to `true`, you need to explicitly set `IS_ENABLED` to `true` to enable selected plugins; `IS_DISABLED` is not checked then.

<a name="resource_monitors_info_sec"></a>

## The Resource Monitors plugin
This plugin reports the state of resource monitors and analyzes the conditions of warehouses. All necessary information found by the plugin is delivered through metrics and logs. Additionally, events are sent when changes in the state of a resource monitor or warehouse are detected.

By default, it executes every 30 minutes and resumes the analysis from where it left off. Before collecting the data, the state of all resource monitors is refreshed.

This plugin:

* logs the current state of each resource monitor and warehouse,
* logs an error if an account-level monitor setup is missing,
* logs a warning if a warehouse is not monitored at all, and
* sends events on all new activities of monitors and warehouses.

    }
}
```

<a name="shares_info_sec"></a>

## The Shares plugin
This plugin enables tracking shares, both inbound and outbound, present in a Snowflake account, or a subset of those subject to configuration. Apart from reporting basic information on each share, as delivered from `SHOW SHARES`, this plugin also:

* logs lists tables that were shared with the current account (inbound share),
* logs objects shared from this account (outbound share),
* sends events when a share is created,
* sends events when an object is granted to a share, and
* sends events when a table is shared, updated, or modified (DDL).

By default, shares are monitored every 60 minutes. It is possible to exclude certain shares (or parts of them) from tracking detailed information.

```

<a name="tasks_info_sec"></a>

## The Tasks plugin
This plugin provides detailed information on the usage and performance of tasks within a Snowflake account. It leverages three key functions/views from Snowflake:

* `TASK_HISTORY`: Delivers the history of task usage for the entire Snowflake account, a specified task, or task graph.
* `TASK_VERSIONS`: Enables retrieval of the history of task versions, with entries indicating the tasks that comprised a task graph and their properties at a given time.
* `SERVERLESS_TASK_HISTORY`: Provides information on the serverless task usage history, including the serverless task name and credits consumed by serverless task usage.

In short, the plugin delivers, as logs by default, information on:

* timestamps of the task execution,
* warehouse ID the task is performed on,
* database ID the task is performed on,
* credits used (as metric).

Additionally, an event is sent when a new task graph version is created. By default, the plugin executes every 90 minutes.

```

<a name="trust_center_info_sec"></a>

## The Trust Center plugin
Delivers new findings reported (within the last 24 hours) by Snowflake Trust Center as log entries.
For findings with `CRITICAL` severity, `CUSTOM_ALERT` event is sent to Dynatrace.

This plugin provides information on:

* scanner name, description, and packages details,
* number of entities at risk as a metric, plus
* details on those entities as `snowflake.entity.details` log attribute.

[Show semantics for this plugin](SEMANTICS.md#trust_center_semantics_sec)

        }
    }
}
```

<a name="users_info_sec"></a>

## The Users plugin
Focuses on providing a broad overview of the users in the system. The data is downloaded from `USERS`, `LOGIN_HISTORY`, and `GRANTS_TO_USERS` views. By default, sends all e-mails hashed (to send them in cleartext, switch `PLUGINS.USERS.IS_HASHED` to `false`). It is possible to create a table with emails-to-hash map which can be accessed at `STATUS.EMAIL_HASH_MAP` by setting `PLUGINS.USERS.RETAIN_EMAIL_HASH_MAP` to `true`. The core functionality of the plugin is to report all active users and those that have been removed since last run, with one log line per user. This information is provided by default, regardless of other enabled modes.
Role monitoring includes three possible modes:

* `DIRECT_ROLES` - users with comma-separated list of roles directly granted to the user, with roles that have been removed since last run;
* `ALL_ROLES` - users with comma-separated list of all roles granted to the user;
* `ALL_PRIVILEGES` - users with all privileges granted per user.

Role monitoring mode can be defined at `PLUGINS.USERS.ROLES_MONITORING_MODE` configuration option. More detailed monitoring modes will impact performance, caution is recommended with more advanced modes.

It is possible to choose more than one mode at a time, which will result in multiple analyses being performed.

The plugin reports on:

* date of last successful login of a user,
* user's default and directly granted roles, and
* user account details.

<a name="warehouse_usage_info_sec"></a>

## The Warehouse Usage plugin
The `warehouse usage` plugin delivers detailed information regarding warehouses' credit usage, workload, and events triggered on them. This plugin provides telemetry based on the `WAREHOUSE_EVENTS_HISTORY`, `WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY`, and `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` views.

It sends:

* metrics on hourly credit usage of warehouses,
* metrics on query load values for executed queries,
* log entries on warehouse events, such as creating, dropping, altering, resizing, resuming, or suspending a cluster or the entire warehouse.
