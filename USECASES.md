## Theme: Security

| Use case                     | In Details                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Data                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Warehouse security monitoring | We can detect potential data security issues and breaches as quickly as possible. We gather information about these security issues as well as entities put at risk by the vulnerabilities.                | [Trust Center plugin](README.md#trust_center_info_sec) |
| Log in and session monitoring | We provide detailed information on logging history and sessions, which is essential for detecting security breaches.                                                                                       | [Login History plugin](README.md#login_history_info_sec) |

## Theme: Operations

| Use case                     | In Details                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Data                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Predicting credits exhaustion | We can be smarter than static threshold sending (or not) emails that a resource monitor's credits are going over the threshold. We could actually, by analyzing costs so far, predict whether they would suffice by the time the resource monitor resets. | [Warehouse Usage plugin](README.md#warehouse_usage_info_sec) |
| Snowflake Trail monitoring   | We gather information from Snowflake Trail which provides enhanced visibility into pipeline health.                                                                                                        | [Event Log plugin](README.md#event_log_info_sec) |

## Theme: Costs

| Use case                     | In Details                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Data                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Resource monitors analysis   | It is not often so simple to determine if the credits limit set on a resource monitor is enough or too much, or might be too little in the near future. With more detailed data, we should be able to analyze it better. | [Resource Monitors plugin](README.md#resource_monitors_info_sec) |
| Budgets analysis             | Combines budget details like spending limits and linked resources, as well as their spending history to allow for complete and comfortable analysis of costs.                                              | [Budgets plugin](README.md#budgets_info_sec) |
| Ingest cost analysis         | Allows for monitoring of data ingestion, credits used during the events, and bytes ingested.                                                                                                              | [Event Usage plugin](README.md#event_usage_info_sec) |
| Serverless tasks analysis    | We can monitor credits spent by serverless tasks which play a vital role in relying on compute resources managed by Snowflake.                                                                             | [Tasks plugin](README.md#tasks_info_sec) |
| Warehouse metering history   | We can monitor the spending of particular warehouses and possibly predict trends in their expenses.                                                                                                        | [Warehouse Usage plugin](README.md#warehouse_usage_info_sec) |

## Theme: Performance

| Use case                     | In Details                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Data                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Query slowdowns              | With anomaly detection we should be able to detect queries that go slower in given context (query tag, table, …)                                                                                           | [Query History plugin](README.md#query_history_info_sec) |
| Table slowdowns              | We would like to know if certain tables should be reindexed to improve performance, i.e., query slowdown may indicate deterioration of table data structure over time, but we should not limit our analysis only to tables that are slow all the time. | [Query History plugin](README.md#query_history_info_sec) |
| Warehouse optimization       | Do we use the right warehouses for the job? Too big or too small?                                                                                                                                          | [Query History plugin](README.md#query_history_info_sec) |
| Multi-level query analysis   | Why are our procedures or functions slow?                                                                                                                                                                  | [Query History plugin](README.md#query_history_info_sec) |
| Detect costly repeated queries | Taking into account the size of the warehouse, we should detect the most costly queries.                                                                                                                  | [Query History plugin](README.md#query_history_info_sec) |
| Monitoring tasks performance | We can monitor and report on task performance to verify if there are any slowdowns or failing tasks.                                                                                                       | [Tasks plugin](README.md#tasks_info_sec) |
| Monitor warehouse loads      | We can monitor the loads put on warehouses to determine which could benefit from additional resources or which don’t utilize their resources fully.                                                        | [Warehouse Usage plugin](README.md#warehouse_usage_info_sec) |
| Query summary                | We provide a summary of queries, giving their count, fastest, slowest, and average running time. This can be useful in detecting slowdowns.                                                                | [Active Queries plugin](README.md#active_queries_info_sec) |
| Current Queries monitoring   | What is the status of my query? How long has it been running?                                                                                                                                              | [Active Queries plugin](README.md#active_queries_info_sec) |

## Theme: Quality

| Use case                     | In Details                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Data                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Data volume monitoring       | We want to understand how data volume in monitored databases, schemas, and tables changes over time; especially if there are any anomalies in the change.                                                  | [Data Volume plugin](README.md#data_volume_info_sec) |
| Snowflake Trail monitoring   | We gather information from Snowflake Trail which provides enhanced visibility into data quality.                                                                                                           | [Event Log plugin](README.md#event_log_info_sec) |
