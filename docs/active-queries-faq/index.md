## Prerequisites

Before starting this troubleshooting guide, ensure you have:

* Access to both Snowflake and Dynatrace environments
* `DTAGENT_VIEWER` role permissions in Snowflake
* Basic understanding of SQL queries and Dynatrace navigation

## Understanding the `active_queries` Plugin

The `active_queries` plugin is responsible for collecting query information from Snowflake. Understanding its behavior is crucial for effective troubleshooting:

### Operating Modes

#### FAST Mode (Default)

* Collects currently `RUNNING`, `QUEUED`, and recently `FINISHED` queries
* Captures queries that intersect with plugin execution intervals (see diagram below)
* Executes every 10 minutes by default

#### SLOW Mode

* Includes all FAST mode functionality
* Additionally retrieves all queries that `FINISHED` or `FAILED` since the previous execution
* Looks back 2 minutes before the end of the last reported query
* More comprehensive but slower

### Important Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Constraint**: Snowflake's `QUERY_HISTORY()` function returns only the most recent 10,000 queries. This is a hard limit that can affect data collection in high-volume environments.

## Troubleshooting Methodology

This guide follows a systematic approach to identify and resolve issues with missing long-running queries. Follow these steps in order for the most effective diagnosis.

## Step 1: Verify Agent Task Execution

**Objective**: Confirm that the `active_queries` plugin is running correctly on the Snowflake side.

### 1.1 Check Task Status and Errors

First, verify that the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent tasks are executing without errors:

1. **Task Name**: `DTAGENT_DB.APP.TASK_DTAGENT_ACTIVE_QUERIES`
2. **What to Check**:
   * Task executes without errors
   * Task runs at expected cadence (10 minutes by default)
   * Some task executions might be missing if a task ran longer than the next scheduled execution

![checking if there are errors when running tasks](dsoa-active-queries-tasks-monitoring-screen.png)

![confirming expected cadence of tasks](dsoa-active-queries-tasks-log-db-perspective.png)

### 1.2 Analyze Query Processing Statistics

Execute the following SQL to check the plugin's recent activity:

```sql
-- Listing last 50 executions of active_queries plugin, 
-- with number of queries processed and time since previous processing
use role DTAGENT_VIEWER;
use schema DTAGENT_DB.STATUS;
use warehouse DTAGENT_WH;

select 
  PROCESS_TIME,
  LAST_TIMESTAMP,
  ENTRIES_COUNT:"processed_entries_cnt"  as PROCESSED_ENTRIES_COUNT,
  timediff(second, 
           LAG(PROCESS_TIME) 
           OVER (ORDER BY PROCESS_TIME), 
           PROCESS_TIME)                 as PROCESSING_GAP_SEC,
from STATUS.PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS_LOG
where MEASUREMENTS_SOURCE = 'active_queries'
order by PROCESS_TIME desc
limit 50
;
```

## Step 2: Validate Data in Dynatrace

**Objective**: Confirm that data from the `active_queries` plugin is correctly transmitted to and available in Dynatrace Grail.

### 2.1 Verify Plugin Execution Reports

Check if the plugin executions are being reported to Dynatrace:

1. **Data Sources to Check**:
   * Business events (bizevents)
   * Query history records
   * Both sources should show consistent data

2. **Metrics to Compare**:
   * Execution cadence (should match Snowflake task execution)
   * Running time of the plugin
   * Number of queries analyzed per execution

![checking cadence of task runs and number of queries reported](dsoa-active-queries-notebook-plugin-executions.png)

### 2.2 Analyze Query Status Distribution

Examine the types of queries being reported:

1. **Expected Status Types**:
   * `RUNNING` queries should always be present (this is the most critical indicator)
   * `QUEUED` queries may be present depending on workload
   * `FINISHED` queries should be present in both modes

2. **Red Flags**:
   * No `RUNNING` queries reported consistently
   * Unusual status distributions
   * Missing expected query types

![confirm tasks with RUNNING status are reported](dsoa-active-queries-notebook-status-reported.png)

### 2.3 Identify Missing Long-Running Queries

Search for queries that should have been reported but appear to be missing:

1. **Query Characteristics to Check**:
   * Long execution times not reflected in `snowflake.time.running` metric
   * Queries not reported with `RUNNING` status despite long execution
   * Discrepancies between expected and actual execution times

![checking for slow queries not reported](dsoa-active-queries-notebook-finding-missing-queries.png)

### 2.4 Expected Results

‚úÖ **Healthy Data Flow**:

* Plugin executions visible in Dynatrace
* Consistent cadence matching Snowflake task execution
* `RUNNING` queries always present
* Query execution times match expectations

‚ùå **Warning Signs**:

* Missing plugin execution reports
* No `RUNNING` queries reported
* Significant discrepancies in execution times
* Gaps in data transmission

## Step 3: Deep Dive Analysis for Missing Queries

**Objective**: When Steps 1 and 2 don't reveal clear issues, perform detailed analysis to identify specific missing queries and their root causes.

### 3.1 Collect Sample Missing Queries

If you've reached this step without finding obvious problems, you need to systematically identify queries that should have been reported but weren't:

1. **Identify Candidate Queries**:
   * Focus on queries with execution times longer than expected reporting intervals
   * Look for queries that ran during plugin execution windows
   * Document query IDs, start times, and execution durations

### 3.2 Cross-Reference with Dynatrace Data

**At Dynatrace**: Check if the missing queries appear in Grail with incorrect data:

1. **Search Strategy**:
   * Look up specific query IDs in Dynatrace
   * Compare reported execution times with actual execution times
   * Check if queries appear with unexpected status values

2. **Data Validation**:
   * Verify query execution time accuracy
   * Confirm status transitions are properly captured
   * Check for any partial data reporting

![listing missing queries](dsoa-active-queries-notebook-checking-missing-queries.png)

### 3.3 Validate Snowflake Query Visibility

**At Snowflake**: Verify that missing queries were actually visible to the `QUERY_HISTORY()` function:

1. **Use the provided SQL script**: [`t00_test_missing_active_queries.off.sql`](t00_test_missing_active_queries.off.sql)
2. **Check Query Accessibility**:
   * Confirm queries appear in `QUERY_HISTORY()` results
   * Verify timing of query availability
   * Check if queries were within the 10,000 query limit

![checking if missing queries were reported on Snowflake side](dsoa-active-queries-snowflake-function-validation.png)

### 3.4 Analysis Patterns

**Consistent Missing Queries**:

* Queries systematically missing from all reporting intervals
* May indicate permission issues or query visibility problems

**Partial Missing Queries**:

* Queries missing from some intervals but present in others
* Missing from beginning, end, or middle of execution periods
* May indicate timing issues or plugin execution problems

**Intermittent Missing Queries**:

* Sporadic missing queries without clear pattern
* May indicate performance issues or temporary connectivity problems

### 3.5 Next Steps Based on Findings

üîç **If queries are missing from Snowflake query history**:

* Check user permissions and role assignments
* Verify query visibility settings
* Review Snowflake query history retention policies

üîç **If queries are visible in Snowflake but missing from Dynatrace**:

* Check data transmission connectivity
* Review plugin execution timing
* Verify Dynatrace ingestion pipeline

üîç **If queries are partially reported**:

* Analyze timing relationships between query execution and plugin runs
* Check for plugin execution timeout issues
* Review query status transition timing

* [Snowflake SQL script](t00_test_missing_active_queries.off.sql)
* Dynatrace notebook for testing [current version](dsoa-active-queries-test-dashboard.json) ( [version 0.7](dsoa-active-queries-test-dashboard-0.7.0.json), [version 0.8.2](dsoa-active-queries-test-dashboard-0.8.2.json) )

## Summary

This systematic approach helps identify the root cause of missing long-running queries by:

1. **Verifying the data collection source** (Snowflake agent tasks)
2. **Confirming data transmission** (Dynatrace data availability)
3. **Performing detailed analysis** (specific query investigation)

Each step builds upon the previous one, allowing you to isolate the problem area and apply targeted solutions. Remember that the 10,000 query limit in Snowflake's `QUERY_HISTORY()` function is a critical constraint that affects data collection in high-volume environments.
