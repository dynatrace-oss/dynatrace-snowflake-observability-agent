## Why observability is crucial

**Data Platform Observability (DPO)** refers to the ability to fully understand the health and performance of your entire data ecosystem. It encompasses monitoring, tracking, and analyzing the usage and processing of data across various stages to ensure they meet the required standards of quality, performance, and security. As data platforms grow in complexity and scale, the need for observability becomes increasingly critical.

When you do not adhere to the Data Platform Observability paradigm and lose track of the overall health of your data platform, you risk not only losing credibility (by delivering late or poor-quality data) but also incurring monetary losses:

* [According to Gartner](https://www.decube.io/post/data-observability-use-case-finance), poor data quality costs organizations an average of **$12.9 million annually**. This includes losses from inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and compliance penalties. For instance, in the financial industry, data observability can help avoid losses due to bad data quality, which can cost over **$14 million a year**.
* [The IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023](https://www.wissen.com/blog/data-security-and-privacy-challenges-in-modern-data-pipelines) highlights that the global average cost of a data breach was **$4.45 million**. Implementing robust observability can help detect and mitigate security threats early, reducing the risk and associated costs.
* Data Platform Observability ensures that data pipelines function smoothly, detecting anomalies and inefficiencies before they impact end-users. This can lead to [improved operational efficiency and reduced downtime](https://dagster.io/guides/data-governance/data-observability-in-2025-pillars-pros-cons-best-practices), which translates to cost savings; extended observability implemented by [Netflix enabled it to improve the reliability of the data pipelines](https://www.acceldata.io/article/critical-use-cases-for-data-observability-that-can-save-your-business-money) and [Airbnb to optimize their usage and costs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/airbnb-optimizes-usage-and-costs-case-study/).
* Effective data governance, supported by observability, helps maintain data quality and compliance with regulations. This is crucial for [avoiding fines and maintaining customer trust](https://www.liquibase.com/blog/data-database-governance-challenges-that-risk-pipeline-productivity-potential).
* Observability can help in [managing and optimizing costs](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consulting/articles/data-observability.html) by providing insights into resource usage and identifying areas where efficiencies can be gained.

## The five core themes of DPO

<img src="src/assets/data-platform-observability-themes.jpg" alt="Five themes of Data Platform Observability" style="width: 1500px; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">

Building on the importance of Data Platform Observability (DPO) in ensuring the health and performance of your data ecosystem, we can analyze DPO through five core themes:

* [security](#security-theme),

The exponential rise in data generation brings new challenges in ensuring data quality. Data Platform Observability (DPO) helps address these challenges by providing insights into the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to usage. This involves monitoring and managing data systems to ensure data remains reliable, accurate, and timely. Effective data quality management is essential for making informed decisions and optimizing digital operations.

Here are five pillars of data observability that help us realize the quality theme, extended with detailed points and case studies.

#### Freshness

Freshness refers to the timeliness of the data. In an ideal data ecosystem, all data is as current as possible. [Observing the freshness of data](https://www.anomalo.com/blog/defining-data-freshness-measuring-and-monitoring-data-timeliness/) helps to ensure that decisions are based on the most recent and relevant information. [Monitoring table refresh events ensures up-to-date information](https://datahubproject.io/learn/data-freshness/). For example, a financial institution relying on outdated data for forecasting may face misguided decisions and misallocated resources; implementing data freshness monitoring will help to make accurate projections and optimize investments.

#### Distribution

Distribution is the statistical spread or range of the data. Data distribution is essential in identifying patterns, outliers, or anomalies. Deviation from the expected distribution can signal an issue in data collection or processing. Identifying patterns and anomalies helps maintain data integrity. A retail company used data distribution monitoring to detect anomalies in sales data, leading to the identification of a data processing error that was causing inaccurate sales reports.

[Chip Huyen discusses the importance of monitoring data distribution shifts](https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html) and provides examples of how deviations can impact model performance. This article includes a case study on a company that faced issues due to data distribution shifts in their machine learning model.

#### Volume

Volume refers to the quantity of data generated or processed during a certain time period. Unexpected increases or drops in the data volume are usually good indicators of undetected issues. The volume aspect often overlaps with data freshness, making it challenging to determine whether the expected but missing data will arrive later or if it's permanently lost. Understanding data growth and its impact on performance is crucial.

[A case study from Neev Data](https://dqops.com/what-is-data-volume/) discusses how a consumer electronics retailer managed data growth by archiving inactive data, which improved system performance and stability.

[Another article from DQOps discusses schema changes and drifts](https://dqops.com/schema-changes-and-drifts-definition-examples/), providing definitions, examples, and best practices for managing and monitoring schema changes. Both emphasize the use of data observability tools to continuously monitor schema drifts.

#### Lineage

Lineage is the journey of the data through a system. It provides insights into where the data comes from (upstream) and what it affects (downstream). Data lineage plays a crucial role in root cause analysis as well as informing impacted systems about an issue as quickly as possible. Understanding data flow and transformations from source to destination is vital.

[Mizrahi discusses](https://www.secoda.co/blog/data-lineage-in-action-case-studies-across-industries) real-world examples of how different industries use data lineage to enhance data transparency and operational efficiency. It highlights the importance of tracking data lineage for root cause analysis and issue resolution.
[In his article from Analytics Vidhya, Shukla discusses](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/11/data-lineage-case-studies-of-data-driven-businesses/) how companies like Netflix, Slack, and Postman have implemented data lineage to improve their data management practices and operational efficiency. [Mitich provides examples on how column-level data lineage helps companies](https://www.selectstar.com/resources/column-level-data-lineage-in-action-5-real-world-examples) across various industries detect data quality issues, streamline compliance, and improve decision-making. For example, Bowery Farming improved data visibility and reduced support tickets, while Xometry saved millions by reducing data outages and improving data accuracy.
