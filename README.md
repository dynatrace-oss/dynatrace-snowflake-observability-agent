Data Platform Observability (DPO) helps address these challenges by providing insights into the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to usage. This involves monitoring and managing data systems to ensure data remains reliable, accurate, and timely. Effective data quality management is essential for making informed decisions and optimizing digital operations.

Here are five pillars of data observability that help us realize the quality theme, extended with detailed points and case studies.

##### Freshness

Freshness refers to the timeliness of the data. In an ideal data ecosystem, all data is as current as possible. [Observing the freshness of data](https://www.anomalo.com/blog/defining-data-freshness-measuring-and-monitoring-data-timeliness/) helps to ensure that decisions are based on the most recent and relevant information. [Monitoring table refresh events ensures up-to-date information](https://datahubproject.io/learn/data-freshness/). For example, a financial institution relying on outdated data for forecasting may face misguided decisions and misallocated resources; implementing data freshness monitoring will help to make accurate projections and optimize investments.

##### Distribution

Distribution is the statistical spread or range of the data. Data distribution is essential in identifying patterns, outliers, or anomalies. Deviation from the expected distribution can signal an issue in data collection or processing. Identifying patterns and anomalies helps maintain data integrity. A retail company used data distribution monitoring to detect anomalies in sales data, leading to the identification of a data processing error that was causing inaccurate sales reports.

[Chip Huyen discusses the importance of monitoring data distribution shifts](https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html) and provides examples of how deviations can impact model performance. This article includes a case study on a company that faced issues due to data distribution shifts in their machine learning model.

##### Volume

Volume refers to the quantity of data generated or processed during a certain time period. Unexpected increases or drops in the data volume are usually good indicators of undetected issues. The volume aspect often overlaps with data freshness, making it challenging to determine whether the expected but missing data will arrive later or if it's permanently lost. Understanding data growth and its impact on performance is crucial.

[A case study from Neev Data](https://dqops.com/what-is-data-volume/) discusses how a consumer electronics retailer managed data growth by archiving inactive data, which improved system performance and stability.

## Architecture and Core Capabilities

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent was designed to augment [Data Platform Observability](#data-platform-observability) capabilities already offered by Dynatrace with OneAgent and custom telemetry (including logs and bizevents) delivered by ETL and other applications. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent aims to fullfil the promise of Data Platform Observability by delivering telemetry data already present in Snowflake directly to Dynatrace as logs, traces, events, and metrics. Depending on what type of telemetry is sent by given Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent plugin one or more [Data Platform Observability themes](#the-five-core-themes-of-dpo) can be supported over one or multiple [layers of Data Platform Observability](#the-three-tiers-of-data-platform-observability).

![High level Data Platform Observability architecture with Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent delivering telemetry to Dynatrace](src/assets/data-platform-observability-dsoa.jpg){style="width: 1000px; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"}

The main capabilities offered by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent are:

1. **Data Collection**: Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent collects and parses useful observability data from various Snowflake sources.
2. **Data Transmission**: After collecting and parsing the information, Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent sends it to Dynatrace tenants where it is easily accessible and ready for analysis.
3. **Alerting**: Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent can send alerts regarding specific information, e.g., potential security breaches, unmonitored warehouses, directly during data parsing, as well as using workflows and anomaly detections set up on the Dynatrace tenant.
4. **Visualization**: Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent delivers telemetry which facilitates building Dynatrace dashboards that ease the process of data analysis.

### High-Level overview

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is designed to take full advantage of Snowflake Snowpark capabilities, allowing active "code" to be scheduled and executed within Snowflake, close to where the telemetry data comes from. Such a design enables telemetry to be sent over to Dynatrace, similar to OneAgent.

The following figure illustrates, at high level, how telemetry data flows from Snowflake sources to Dynatrace for consumption.

![overview of flow of telemetry data through Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to Dynatrace](src/assets/dsoa-overview.jpg){width=80%}

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is designed for easy extension with new plugins, each of which can utilize the core functions to deliver telemetry data via logs, spans/traces, events, bizevents, and metrics.

By default, each plugin is executed with an independent Snowflake task, scheduled to run at its own interval. Additionally, it is possible to call multiple plugins from a single Snowflake task if needed, providing flexible scheduling options.

The telemetry data can come from various sources, not only from `snowflake.account_usage` views but also from functions/procedures and "show" command calls. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent encapsulates each telemetry data into views delivered by "plugins," with each plugin focusing on delivering telemetry from one or more sources related to a specific subject, e.g., query history or dynamic tables.

### Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent objects in Snowflake

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is fully contained within a single database (`DTAGENT_DB`) with a dedicated warehouse (`DTAGENT_WH`) and two roles per each Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instance deployed:

* `DTAGENT_ADMIN` that owns all other objects, and
* `DTAGENT_VIEWER` that is designed to query and send telemetry data.

Since it is possible to run multiple Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instances within one Snowflake account, additional instances (deployed in a multitenancy mode), have the names of those four objects include the tag name, i.e., `DTAGENT_$TAG_DB`, `DTAGENT_$TAG_WH`, `DTAGENT_$TAG_ADMIN`, and `DTAGENT_$TAG_VIEWER`.

The figure below depicts objects which are created and maintained by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent within dedicated database in Snowflake:

![Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent objects in Snowflake](src/assets/dsoa-snowflake-objects.jpg){width=80%}

#### The `APP` schema

This is the main schema maintained by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent. It contains two main stored procedures:

* `DTAGENT_DB.APP.DTAGENT(plugins)` is the main procedure of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, which sends telemetry generated by executing one or multiple [plugins](#plugins). Telemetry views queried by plugins use the internal telemetry API available in this procedure to send telemetry data directly to Dynatrace.
* `DTAGENT_DB.APP.SEND_TELEMETRY(sources, params)` is based on the same core and internal telemetry API code as `DTAGENT()` but instead of using plugins to query, process, and send telemetry data, it enables to [send arbitrary data](#sending-custom-telemetry) from given tables/views/queries or array/objects to Dynatrace.

Additionally, a set of helper functions to check the timestamp of the last telemetry piece of a given type processed so far (`F_LAST_PROCESSED_TS()`) or get configuration parameters (`F_GET_CONFIG_VALUE()`), plus procedures helping to set up and maintain the event log table, if it is set up by and managed this Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instance.

Plugins can define their main and helper views, helper procedures, and tasks which invoke Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent with the given plugin at a given schedule.

In order for Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to communicate with Dynatrace API, dedicated `SECRET`, `NETWORK RULE`, and `EXTERNAL ACCESS INTEGRATION` are set.

#### The `CONFIG` schema

Contains two tables:

* `CONFIGURATIONS` with all configurable options of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, including internal API and plugins
* `INSTRUMENTS` for semantic dictionary definitions of all dimensions, attributes, and metrics that Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent can deliver to Dynatrace.

Information from both tables is used to initialize Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent main stored procedures.

Additionally, a set of helper procedures is delivered to change the behavior of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent that is not initialized during runtime, e.g., the number of credits allowed daily by internal resource monitor, or the schedule of each plugin's execution.

#### The `STATUS` schema

Provides a table (`PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS_LOG`) with a log of all Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent executions and either an `EVENT_LOG` table set by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent for this account or a view over the existing account-level event log table.

Plugins can maintain their own "status" tables in this schema. For example, the `query history` plugin maintains the list of recently processed query IDs in `PROCESSED_QUERIES_CACHE`.

It is a good practice to accompany status tables with helper procedures, such as `LOG_PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS()` for the `PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS_LOG` table.

### Telemetry flow

Telemetry delivered by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to Dynatrace becomes available in Grail and can be accessed with DQL at Notebooks, Dashboards, Workflows, and Anomaly detection rules.

The following figure depicts in details, each step of how the telemetry data flows from Snowflake telemetry sources through Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to Dynatrace; in this case execution of `query_history` plugin is used as example.

![detailed flow of telemetry data on query history from Snowflake sources through Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to Dynatrace Grail and further](src/assets/dsoa-dataflow.jpg){width=80%}

1. The process starts with Snowflake task `TASK_DTAGENT_QUERY_HISTORY` calling the `DTAGENT()` procedure with `query_history` as a parameter:

    * The procedure initializes by reading the configuration and semantic dictionary (instruments).
    * A query tag is set for the session to identify this particular execution of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent in Snowflake telemetry.
    * Before starting the processing, a BizEvent is sent to Dynatrace to indicate the start of a single plugin execution; a single all to `DTAGENT()` procedure can execute one or more plugins, one by one.

1. The `query_history` plugin initializes telemetry data for sending by calling the `P_REFRESH_RECENT_QUERIES()` procedure, which

    * data from `QUERY_HISTORY` and `ACCESS_HISTORY` tables, filtering out already processed queries, and
    * prepares a standardized view with telemetry based on that information.

1. For the slowest queries, the plugin enhances the telemetry with

    * a query profile by calling `GET_QUERY_OPERATOR_STATS()`, and
    * estimated query acceleration with estimates from `SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION()`.

1. Telemetry for each query is then sent to Dynatrace as traces, logs, and metrics; no events are sent by the `query_history` plugin.

1. The execution of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent finalizes with

    * the list of processed queries is put into the `PROCESSED_QUERIES_CACHE` to avoid processing them again,
    * execution stats being recorded in the `PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS_LOG` table,
    * a BizEvent sent to Dynatrace indicating the end of execution of the plugin is sent, and
    * the query tag for the session is being reset.

### Internal API for sending telemetry

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent offers an internal API to send telemetry as [OTEL logs](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/opentelemetry/post-logs), [OTEL spans](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/opentelemetry/post-traces), [metrics](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2), [events](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/events-v2), and [BizEvents](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/business-analytics-v2).

#### Sending logs

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent sends logs to Dynatrace using the [Python OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/) with [Dynatrace OTEL collector for logs](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/opentelemetry/post-logs).

#### Sending traces/spans

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent can create traces/spans using [Python OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/) configured to deliver data to [Dynatrace OTEL collector for traces](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/opentelemetry/post-traces). In case `trace_id` or `span_id`, or both, are available, e.g., in Snowflake Trail telemetry, their values are used when sending traces/spans.

Traces/spans delivery can be adjusted in the configuration:

```json
{
    "OTEL": {
        "SPANS": {
            "EXPORT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS": 10000,
            "MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE": 50
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sending metrics

Due to limitations of OpenTelemetry metrics protocol, Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent sends metrics via the [Dynatrace Metrics API v2](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2).

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent sends metrics in batches of aggregated data once they reach the payload size limit for a request to avoid creating redundant calls.

The internal telemetry API enables for metrics cache to be manually flushed before reaching the maximum payload. The maximum size of payload and maximum number of retries to send data can be configured:

```json
{
    "OTEL": {
        "METRICS": {
            "MAX_RETRIES": 5,
            "MAX_BATCH_SIZE": 1000000
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sending events

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent enables to send events using the [Dynatrace Events API v2](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/events-v2).

Each event has columns specifying the event type and title accompanied by additional attributes describing its details. Dynatrace API for Events require each event to be send separately. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent enables to configure maximum number of retries and delay (in milliseconds) between retries, in case event could not be delivered.

```json
{
    "OTEL": {
        "EVENTS": {
            "MAX_RETRIES": 5,
            "RETRY_DELAY": 10000
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sending BizEvents

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is also capable of sending special type of events to Dynatrace, i.e., business events (BizEvents), using the [Dynatrace Business Events API v2](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/business-analytics-v2).

Those events are usually used for tracking execution of actions within Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent flow.
Each posted business event is required to have fields specifying its `id`, `source`, `specversion`, and `type`. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent sends business events as batch of `CloudEvent` objects.

There are multiple parameters of delivering BizEvents can be configured:

```json
{
    "OTEL": {
        "BIZ_EVENTS": {
            "MAX_RETRIES": 5,
            "MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES": 1000 * 1024 * 5,
            "MAX_EVENT_COUNT": 400,
            "RETRY_DELAY_MS": 10000,
            "RETRY_ON_STATUS": [429, 502, 503]
        }
    }
}
```

### Sending custom telemetry

Apart from sending telemetry prepared by plugins, Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent enables sending custom telemetry using the `DTAGENT_DB.APP.SEND_TELEMETRY(sources VARIANT, params OBJECT)` procedure.

The `sources` parameter specifies the content to be sent to Dynatrace and can be:

* a fully qualified name of a view or table,
* a `SELECT` SQL statement,
* a single object, or
* an array of objects.

The `params` parameter is an object with the following keys (parameters) that can be used to control the behavior of the `DTAGENT_DB.APP.SEND_TELEMETRY` procedure:

| Param Name  | Default Value | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| `auto_mode` | `true`        | If not set to `false`, Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent expects that data delivered in the `source` follows Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent data structure. |
| `metrics`   | `true`        | Should we send metrics based on `METRICS` (auto-mode only). |
| `logs`      | `true`        | `false` will disable sending telemetry as logs. |
| `events`    | `$auto_mode`  | `false` will disable sending events based on `EVENT_TIMESTAMPS` (auto-mode); otherwise, `true` will enable sending custom objects as events. |
| `bizevents` | `false`       | `true` will enable sending custom objects as bizevents. |

This stored procedure returns a tuple with number of objects sent:

* all entries,
* entries sent as logs,
* entries sent as metrics,
* entries sent as events,
* entries sent as bizevents.

#### Default data structure

By default, this stored procedure expects each source object or table/view/query results row to be structured according to the following schema:

This schema corresponds to the names and structure of columns in the telemetry view created by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent plugins to streamline the process of writing new plugins by using high level internal telemetry API, which can automatically identify metrics and events to be send from given payload.

#### Examples of sending custom telemetry

Here is a couple of different examples of sending data to Dynatrace with `SEND_TELEMETRY()`.

##### Sending logs and metrics from a view

This example sends logs and metrics based on data from the `MY_DB.MY_SCHEMA.V_MY_VIEW` view, which follows the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent data structure, without generating events based on `EVENT_TIMESTAMPS`:

```sql
call APP.SEND_TELEMETRY('MY_DB.MY_SCHEMA.V_MY_VIEW'::variant, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('events', false));
```

##### Sending logs, events, and bizevents from an array of custom objects

This example sends logs, events, and bizevents based on data from an array of custom objects:

```sql
call APP.SEND_TELEMETRY(ARRAY_CONSTRUCT(
        OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
            'timestamp', 1732103723000,
            'status.code', 'OK',
            '_message', 'This is a test object 1',
            'value.int', 10,
            'value.str', 'test',
            'value.bool', true,
            'value.list', ARRAY_CONSTRUCT(1, '2', 3),
            'value.dict', OBJECT CONSTRUCT('k', 'v', 'k2', 2)
        ),
        OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
            'timestamp', 1732103723000,
            'status.code', 'OK',
            '_message', 'This is a test object 2',
            'event.type', 'PERFORMANCE_EVENT',
            'value.int', 10000000,
            'value.str', 'test 2',
            'value.bool', false,
            'value.list', ARRAY CONSTRUCT('1', '2'),
            'value.dict', OBJECT CONSTRUCT('k', 1, 'k2', 2)
        ),
        OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
            'timestamp', 1732103723000,
            'status.code', 'ERROR',
            'event.type', 'ERROR_EVENT',
            'test.message', 'This is a test object 3',
            'value.int', -10,
            'value.str', 'error test',
            'value.bool', NULL,
            'value.list', ARRAY_CONSTRUCT(1, 3),
            'value.dict', OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('k', false, 'k2', true)
        )
    )::variant, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('auto_mode', false, 'events', true, 'bizevents', true));
```

### Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent self-monitoring

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent has configurable self-monitoring capabilities.

```json
{
    "PLUGINS": {
        "SELF_MONITORING": {
            "SEND_BIZEVENTS_ON_DEPLOY": true,
            "SEND_BIZEVENTS_ON_RUN": true
        }
    }
}
```

With `SEND_BIZEVENTS_ON_RUN` set to `true` Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent will provide updates to DT on the statuses of executed tasks in form of bizevents.
The messages contain - among others - the current status of task execution (possible values `STARTED`, `FINISHED`, `FAILED`), task name and run id.

Example of task status bizevent payload.

```json
{
    "event.type": "dsoa.task",
    "host.name": "snowflakecomputing.com",
    "service.name": "dynatrace",
    "dsoa.run.context": "self-monitoring",
    "dsoa.run.id": "2c8988a1b94d43aeaa11d3c83d45468b",
    "dsoa.task.exec.id": "2025-03-18 10:58:59.364252",
    "dsoa.task.exec.status": "STARTED",
    "dsoa.task.name": "query_history",
    "telemetry.exporter.name": "dynatrace.snowagent",
    "telemetry.exporter.version": "0.8.0.0"
}
```

With `SEND_BIZEVENTS_ON_DEPLOY`, Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent will send a bizevent to DT with each deployment run. Depending on the type of deployment, the event titles will be set as follows:

* full deployment ("New complete Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent deployment."),
* configuration update ("New Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent config and instruments deployment."),
* teardown ("Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent teardown initiated."),
* API key update ("Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent API key redeployed.").

Example of deployment bizevent payload.

```json
{
    "type": "CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT",
    "title": "New complete Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent deployment.",
    "db.system": "snowflake",
    "deployment.environment": "TEST",
    "host.name": "snowflakecomputing.com",
    "telemetry.exporter.name": "dynatrace.snowagent",
    "dsoa.deployment.parameter": "full_deployment"
}
```

<a name="active_queries_info_sec"></a>

### The Active Queries plugin
This plugin lists currently running queries and tracks the status of queries that have finished since the last check.
It reports finding from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY()` function.

Provides details on compilation and running (until now) time of the currently running query or recently finished ones.

By default information on all queries is reported as logs and metrics.

Active queries can be reported in two different modes:

* Fast mode - only reports currently active queries. Chosen with `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.FAST_MODE` set to `true`.
* Normal mode - reports queries with start timestamp up to 15 minutes from the current time. Chosen with `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.FAST_MODE` set to `false`.

Additionally, you can decide to monitor details for queries only with selected execution status, by using the `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS` configuration parameter; by default: no additional filters are applied with `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS` set to empty (`[]`).
Multiple statuses can be chosen (for example: `["RUNNING", "QUEUED"]`). This filtering will be applied on top of the chosen mode.

> **HINT:** Please note that Snowflake's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY()` function can return up to 10000 most recent queries. Therefore, if you decide to monitor queries other than just those currently `RUNNING` or being `QUEUED`, on a heavily loaded Snowflake account, there might be more than 10000 queries reported within the default 10-min interval between executing the `active_queries` plugin. Hence, if you see that the following query returns 10000 at any point, you may want to adjust the schedule of the `active_queries` plugin to avoid data loss.

```dql
fetch logs
| filter db.system == "snowflake"
| filter dsoa.run.context == "active_queries"
| filter deployment.environment == "YOUR_ENV"
| sort timestamp asc
| summarize {
  timestamp = takeFirst(timestamp),
  start = takeFirst(timestamp),
  end = takeLast(timestamp),
  timeframe = timeframe(from: takeFirst(timestamp), to:takeLast(timestamp)),
  count = count()
}, by: {
  dsoa.run.id
}
```

<a name="budgets_info_sec"></a>

### The Budgets plugin
This plugin enables monitoring of Snowflake budgets, resources linked to them, and their expenditures. It sets up and manages the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent's own budget.

All budgets within the account are reported on as logs and metrics; this includes their details, spending limit, and recent expenditures.
The plugin runs once a day and excludes already reported expenditures.

    }
}
```

<a name="data_volume_info_sec"></a>

### The Data Volume plugin
This plugin enables tracking the volume of data (in bytes and rows) stored in Snowflake through reported metrics.
Additionally, it sends events when there are changes in table structure (DDL) or content.

The following information is reported:

* table type,
* timestamp of the last data update and the time elapsed since then,
* timestamp of the last DDL and the time elapsed since then,
* number of bytes in the table, and
* number of rows in the table.

```

<a name="dynamic_tables_info_sec"></a>

### The Dynamic Tables plugin
This plugin enables tracking availability and performance of running Snowflake dynamic table refreshes, via logs and a set of metrics.
Additionally, there are events sent when dynamic tables refresh tasks are executed.

The telemetry is based on checking 3 functions:

* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLES()`,
* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY()`, and
* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_GRAPH_HISTORY()`.

[Show semantics for this plugin](#dynamic_tables_semantics_sec)

<a name="event_log_info_sec"></a>

### The Event Log plugin
This plugin delivers to Dynatrace data reported by Snowflake Trail in the `EVENT TABLE`.

By default, it runs every 30 minutes and registers entries from the last 12 hours, omitting the ones, which:

* where already delivered,
* with scope set to `DTAGENT_OTLP` as they are internal log recording entries sent over the OpenTelemetry protocol
* related to execution of other instances of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, or
* with importance below the level set as `CORE.LOG_LEVEL`, i.e., only warnings or errors from the given Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instance are reported.

By default, it produces log entries containing the following information:

* timestamp of the entry to Snowflake Trail,
* timestamp the plugin observed the entry,
* content,
* type of record, and
* trace of the entry.

Metric entries (`RECORD_TYPE = 'METRIC'`) are sent via Dynatrace Metrics API v2.
Metrics that were identified during development time will have their semantics included already in the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent semantic dictionary; semantics for any new metric will be copied from information provided by Snowflake Trail.

Span entries (`RECORD_TYPE = 'SPAN'`) are send via OpenTelemetry Trace API, with trace ID and span ID set as reported by Snowflake Trail.

Unless [OpenTelemetry-compliant attribute names](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/), such as `code.function`, are reported in the event log table, Snowflake prefixes all internal telemetry names with `snow.`. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent passes all telemetry under the original names provided by Snowflake in the event log table. The only exception is the `SCOPE` column, where attribute names are short (like `name`) and Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent reports them with `snowflake.event.scope.` prefix, e.g., `snowflake.event.scope.name`.

            "IS_DISABLED": false
        }
    }
}
```

> **IMPORTANT**: A dedicated cleanup task, `APP.TASK_DTAGENT_EVENT_LOG_CLEANUP`, ensures that the `EVENT_LOG` table contains only data no older than the duration you define with the `PLUGINS.EVENT_LOG.RETENTION_HOURS` configuration option.  
> You can schedule this task separately using the `PLUGINS.EVENT_LOG.SCHEDULE_CLEANUP` configuration option, run the cleanup procedure `APP.P_CLEANUP_EVENT_LOG()` manually, or manage the retention of data in the `EVENT_LOG` table yourself.

> **INFO**: The `EVENT_LOG` table cleanup process works only if this specific instance of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent set up the table.

<a name="event_usage_info_sec"></a>

### The Event Usage plugin
This plugin delivers information regarding the history of data loaded into Snowflake event tables. It reports telemetry from the `EVENT_USAGE_HISTORY` view.

Log entries include include:

* timestamps: start and end time of the event,
* bytes ingested during the event (also reported as `snowflake.data.ingested` metric),
* credits consumed during the event (also reported as `snowflake.credits.used` metric).

        }
    }
}
```

<a name="login_history_info_sec"></a>

### The Login History plugin
Provides detail about logins history as well as sessions history in form of logs.
The log entries include information on:

* users id who is regarded by the log,
* potential error codes,
* type of Snowflake connection,
* timestamp of logging in,
* environment the client used during the session,
* timestamp of the start of the session,
* timestamp of the end of the session,
* reason of ending the session, and
* version used by the client.

Additionally, when login error is reported, a `CUSTOM_ALERT` event is sent.

    }
}
```

<a name="query_history_info_sec"></a>

### The Query History plugin
This plugin provides information on what SQL queries were run, by whom, when, and their performance. This information is extracted from the `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` view, combined with details such as related objects or estimated costs from `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY`. For the slowest queries, additional information is retrieved from the `QUERY_OPERATOR_STATS` and `SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION` functions.

By default, this plugin executes every 30 minutes and analyzes queries that finished within the last 2 hours and have not already been processed.

Among the information it provides are:

* the IDs of processed queries,
* runtimes of processed queries,
* numbers of credits used by processed queries,
* number of bytes scanned during the completion of a query, and
* number of partitions scanned during the completion of a query.

Each query execution is reported as a log line and span, with a hierarchy of spans made from the relation to parent queries. If the query profile was retrieved with `QUERY_OPERATOR_STATS`, it is delivered as span events and additional log lines. This plugin also delivers many metrics based on telemetry information provided by Snowflake.

<a name="resource_monitors_info_sec"></a>

### The Resource Monitors plugin
This plugin reports the state of resource monitors and analyzes the conditions of warehouses. All necessary information found by the plugin is delivered through metrics and logs. Additionally, events are sent when changes in the state of a resource monitor or warehouse are detected.

By default, it executes every 30 minutes and resumes the analysis from where it left off. Before collecting the data, the state of all resource monitors is refreshed.

This plugin:

* logs the current state of each resource monitor and warehouse,
* logs an error if an account-level monitor setup is missing,
* logs a warning if a warehouse is not monitored at all, and
* sends events on all new activities of monitors and warehouses.

<a name="shares_info_sec"></a>

### The Shares plugin
This plugin enables tracking shares, both inbound and outbound, present in a Snowflake account, or a subset of those subject to configuration. Apart from reporting basic information on each share, as delivered from `SHOW SHARES`, this plugin also:

* logs lists tables that were shared with the current account (inbound share),
* logs objects shared from this account (outbound share),
* sends events when a share is created,
* sends events when an object is granted to a share, and
* sends events when a table is shared, updated, or modified (DDL).

By default, shares are monitored every 60 minutes. It is possible to exclude certain shares (or parts of them) from tracking detailed information.

### The Tasks plugin
This plugin provides detailed information on the usage and performance of tasks within a Snowflake account. It leverages three key functions/views from Snowflake:

* `TASK_HISTORY`: Delivers the history of task usage for the entire Snowflake account, a specified task, or task graph.
* `TASK_VERSIONS`: Enables retrieval of the history of task versions, with entries indicating the tasks that comprised a task graph and their properties at a given time.
* `SERVERLESS_TASK_HISTORY`: Provides information on the serverless task usage history, including the serverless task name and credits consumed by serverless task usage.

In short, the plugin delivers, as logs by default, information on:

* timestamps of the task execution,
* warehouse ID the task is performed on,
* database ID the task is performed on,
* credits used (as metric).

Additionally, an event is sent when a new task graph version is created. By default, the plugin executes every 90 minutes.

#### Tasks default configuration

To disable this plugin, set `IS_DISABLED` to `true`.

In case the global property `PLUGINS.DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT` is set to `true`, you need to explicitly set `IS_ENABLED` to `true` to enable selected plugins; `IS_DISABLED` is not checked then.

```json
{
    "PLUGINS": {
        "TASKS": {
            "SCHEDULE": "USING CRON 30 * * * * UTC",
            "IS_DISABLED": false
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="trust_center_info_sec"></a>

### The Trust Center plugin
Delivers new findings reported (within the last 24 hours) by Snowflake Trust Center as log entries.
For findings with `CRITICAL` severity, `CUSTOM_ALERT` event is sent to Dynatrace.

This plugin provides information on:

* scanner name, description, and packages details,
* number of entities at risk as a metric, plus
* details on those entities as `snowflake.entity.details` log attribute.

            "IS_DISABLED": false
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="users_info_sec"></a>

### The Users plugin
Focuses on providing a broad overview of the users in the system. The data is downloaded from `USERS`, `LOGIN_HISTORY`, and `GRANTS_TO_USERS` views. By default, sends all e-mails hashed (to send them in cleartext, switch `PLUGINS.USERS.IS_HASHED` to `false`). It is possible to create a table with emails-to-hash map which can be accessed at `STATUS.EMAIL_HASH_MAP` by setting `PLUGINS.USERS.RETAIN_EMAIL_HASH_MAP` to `true`. The core functionality of the plugin is to report all active users and those that have been removed since last run, with one log line per user. This information is provided by default, regardless of other enabled modes.
Role monitoring includes three possible modes:

* `DIRECT_ROLES` - users with comma-separated list of roles directly granted to the user, with roles that have been removed since last run;
* `ALL_ROLES` - users with comma-separated list of all roles granted to the user;
* `ALL_PRIVILEGES` - users with all privileges granted per user.

Role monitoring mode can be defined at `PLUGINS.USERS.ROLES_MONITORING_MODE` configuration option. More detailed monitoring modes will impact performance, caution is recommended with more advanced modes.

It is possible to choose more than one mode at a time, which will result in multiple analyses being performed.

The plugin reports on:

* date of last successful login of a user,
* user's default and directly granted roles, and
* user account details.

        }
    }
}
```

<a name="warehouse_usage_info_sec"></a>

### The Warehouse Usage plugin
The `warehouse usage` plugin delivers detailed information regarding warehouses' credit usage, workload, and events triggered on them. This plugin provides telemetry based on the `WAREHOUSE_EVENTS_HISTORY`, `WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY`, and `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` views.

It sends:

* metrics on hourly credit usage of warehouses,
* metrics on query load values for executed queries,
* log entries on warehouse events, such as creating, dropping, altering, resizing, resuming, or suspending a cluster or the entire warehouse.

## How to Install

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent comes in the form of a series of SQL scripts (accompanied with a few configuration files), which need to be deployed at Snowflake by executing them in the correct order.

### Deploying Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent

The default option to install Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is from the distribution package.
Should you require to install Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent from the sources, please check the [Installing Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent from sources](#installing-dynatrace-snowflake-observability-agent-from-sources) section before continuing here.
To deploy Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, run the `./deploy.sh` command:

```bash
./deploy.sh $config_name $file_prefix
```

The `$config_name` parameter is required and must match one of the previously created configuration files.

The `$file_prefix` parameter is optional and can take multiple values:

* If left empty, all SQL scripts will be executed at once.
* If set to `config`, the configuration table will be updated using the config file specified by the `$config_name` parameter.
* If set to `apikey`, the Dynatrace Access Token (API Key) will be stored in Snowflake and made available only to the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent stored procedure.
* If set to `manual`, a complete SQL script with all commands necessary to deploy and set up Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent will be produced; use the Snowflake Web UI to execute it.
* If set to `teardown`, Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent will be uninstalled from your Snowflake account.
* If set to any other value, only the files with base names starting with that `$file_prefix` will be executed as part of the deployment procedure.

You should store the Access Token for your Dynatrace tenant (to which you want to send telemetry from your environment) as the environment variable `DTAGENT_TOKEN`. The token should have the following scopes enabled:

* `logs.ingest`
* `metrics.ingest`
* `events.ingest`
* `bizevents.ingest`
* `openTelemetryTrace.ingest`

We **strongly** recommend to ensure your token is not recorded in shell script history; please find an example how to define `DTAGENT_TOKEN` environment variable on Linux or WSL below:

```bash
export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace
## make sure to put the space before the next command to ensure that the TOKEN is not recorded in bash history
 export DTAGENT_TOKEN="dynatrace-token"
```

If you do not set the `DTAGENT_TOKEN` environment variable, or if it does not contain a valid token value:

* The Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent deployment process **WILL NOT** send self-monitoring BizEvents to your Dynatrace tenant to mark the start and finish of the deployment process.
* The deployment process *will not be able* to set `DTAGENT_API_KEY` when deploying the complete configuration (`./deploy.sh $config_name`) or when updating just the API key (`./deploy.sh $config_name apikey`). In these cases, **YOU WILL** be prompted to provide the correct `DTAGENT_TOKEN` value during deployment.

No additional objects need to be provided for the deployment process on the Snowflake side. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent will build a database to store his information - `DTAGENT_DB` by default or `DTAGENT_{TAG}_DB` if tag is provided (see [Multitenancy](#multitenancy)).

The complete log of deployment and the script executed during deployment is available as `.logs/dtagent-deploy-$config_name-$current_date.log`.

### Setting up a profile

Before you deploy Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent to Snowflake, you need to configure a profile with necessary information to establish connection between single Snowflake account and single Dynatrace account.
Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent enables to send telemetry from multiple Snowflake accounts to one or multiple (see [Multitenancy](#multitenancy)) Dynatrace account.
You will need to create a profile configuration file for each Snowflake-Dynatrace pair.

#### Creating profile configuration file for Snowflake-Dynatrace connection

You must create the deployment configuration file in the `conf/` directory.
The file must follow `config-$config_name.json` naming convention and the content as presented in the `conf/config-template.json` template.
Make sure the `CORE` entries; you can skip the rest.
Optionally you can adjust plugin configurations.

One of the configuration options for each Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent plugin is the `SCHEDULE`, which determines when the Snowflake task responsible for executing this plugin should start.
By default, the majority of tasks are scheduled to execute on the hour or half hour to increase warehouse utilization and reduce costs.
Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent allows you to configure the schedule for each plugin separately using one of three formats:

* CRON format: `USING CRON */30 * * * * UTC`
* Interval format: `30 MINUTES`
* Task graph definition: `after DTAGENT_DB.APP.TASK_DTAGENT_QUERY_HISTORY_GRANTS`

> **NOTE:** Due to Snowflake limitations, using task graph definition (`AFTER`) requires all tasks in one graph to be owned by the same role.

##### Multi-configuration deployment

The configuration file is a JSON array containing multiple configuration definitions â€” one for each environment. This enables you to deploy to several environments, potentially with similar settings, in a single operation.

**HINT:** When specifying multiple configurations, the first configuration in the array serves as the base. All subsequent configurations inherit settings from the first, so you only need to specify the differences for each additional environment. This helps reduce duplication of common configuration values.

```jsonc
[
    {
        "CORE": {
            "DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT": "ENV1",
            /// ...
        },
        "OTEL": {
            /// ...
        },
        "PLUGINS": {
            /// ...
        }
    },
    {
        "CORE": {
            "DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT": "ENV2"
        }
    }
]
```

##### Multitenancy

If you want to deliver telemetry from one Snowflake account to multiple Dynatrace tenants, or require different configurations and schedules for some plugins, you can achieve this by creating configuration with multiple deployment environment (Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instances) definitions. Specify a different `CORE.DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` parameter for each instance. We **strongly** recommend also defining a unique `CORE.TAG` for each additional Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instance running on the same Snowflake account.

Example:

```jsonc
[
    {
        //...
        "CORE": {
            //...
            "DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT": "TEST-MT001",
            //...
            "TAG": "MT001"
        },
        //...
    }
]
```

You can specify the configuration for each instance in a separate configuration file or use the multi-configuration deployment described above.

##### IMPORTANT

* Running `./deploy.sh $config_name` expects a `conf/config-$config_name.json` file with at least one configuration defined.
* If you have multiple `CORE.DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` values specified in a single configuration file, you will need a [matching `snow connection` profile for each one](#setting-up-connection-to-snowflake).
* If you plan to deploy configurations that send telemetry to different Dynatrace tenants, **DO NOT** define the `DTAGENT_TOKEN` environment variable in advance; you will be prompted to provide it separately for each configuration as needed.

#### Setting up connection to Snowflake

You must add a connection definition to Snowflake using the following command. The connection name must follow this pattern: `snow_agent_$config_name`. Only the required fields are necessary, as external authentication is used by default. These connection profiles are used **ONLY** during the deployment process.

To deploy Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent properly, the specified user must be able to assume the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role on the target Snowflake account.

**HINT:** Running `./setup.sh $config_name` or `./deploy.sh $config_name` will prompt you to create Snowflake connection profiles named `snow_agent_$ENV`, where `ENV` matches each `CORE.DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` in your configuration. If these profiles do not exist, you will be prompted to create them.

**WARNING:** If you wish to use a different connection name or pattern, you must modify the `./deploy.sh` script and update the `--connection` parameter in the `snow sql` call.

```bash
snow connection add --connection-name snow_agent_$ENV
```

To list your currently defined connections run:

```bash
snow connection list
```

Here is an example of how to fill in the form to configure connection based on external browser authentication, which is a recommended way for users authenticating with external SSO:

```bash
Snowflake account name: ${YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME.REGION_NAME}
Snowflake username: ${YOUR_USERNAME}
Snowflake password [optional]: 
Role for the connection [optional]: 
Warehouse for the connection [optional]: 
Database for the connection [optional]: 
Schema for the connection [optional]: 
Connection host [optional]: 
Connection port [optional]: 
Snowflake region [optional]: 
Authentication method [optional]: externalbrowser
Path to private key file [optional]: 
```

You can also run this command to fill in the required and recommended parts:

```bash
snow connection add --connection-name snow_agent_$config_name --account ${YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME.REGION_NAME} --user ${YOUR_USERNAME} --authenticator externalbrowser
```

If you have any issues setting up the connection check [the SnowCli documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql).

### Prerequisites

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux

On Windows it is necessary to install Windows Subsystem for Linux before proceeding with the following steps. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent must be executed through WSL to guarantee proper functioning: WSL version 2.0 or higher is recommended (see [Install WSL guide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install):

#### MacOS

You will need `brew` installed and up to date (XCode) Command Line Tools.

To install `brew` go to [Brew installation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
To update Command Line Tools you need to run

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

or go to Software Update in System Settings

### Installing Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent from sources

For the development purposes you can install Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent from sources.

#### Getting local copy of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent

To get the source code of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent you will need `git` installed.
Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-snowflake-observability-agent.git
```

Otherwise you should receive a package with Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent named `dynatrace_snowflake_observability_agent-$version.zip` which you should unpack.

#### Installing necessary software

You can simply run `./setup.sh` to install all necessary software on your MacOS or Ubuntu.

##### Creating virtual environment

Once you have Python (only versions 3.9 through 3.11 are supported) installed, it is a good practice to operate with Python code within a virtual environment (see [Virtual Environment Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)). To create and active one run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

##### Installing required packages

Packages necessary to run the program should be installed using following commands.

We need [Snowflake CLI](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-cli) installed either via pipx

```bash
## if You do not have pipx installed, run
sudo apt install pipx
## with pipx installed, run
pipx install snowflake-cli-labs
```

or Homebrew (macOS only):

```bash
brew tap snowflakedb/snowflake-cli
brew install snowflake-cli
snow --help
```

Once this is done install the remaining Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you need to install few more development tools:

* [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)

In Windows WSL / Ubuntu linux run:

```bash
sudo apt install jq
```

On macOS run:

```bash
brew install jq
```

* gawk

In Windows WSL / Ubuntu linux run:

```bash
sudo apt install gawk
```

On macOS run:

```bash
brew install gawk
```

* **Status Logging**: Fixed how results of running Agent are reported in `STATUS.LOG_PROCESSED_MEASUREMENTS` in case of no data being processed.
* **Span Hierarchy**: Fixed span hierarchy reported from Snowflake query parent ID.

### Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent 0.8.2

Released on May 20, 2025.

#### Breaking Changes in 0.8.2

* **Multi-Config Deployment**: Configuration is now expected to be a JSON array of objects. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is deployed to all specified configurations, with keys from the first configuration taking precedence in case of conflicts.
* **Users Plugin**: Now sends all user-related information as logs.
* **Timestamp-Triggered Events**: The name of the timestamp field that triggered the event is now sent as the value of the `snowflake.event.trigger` field in the event.

#### Plugins Updated in 0.8.2

* **Active Queries**:
  * Introduced a configurable fast mode via the `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.FAST_MODE` key. The existing filter from `PLUGINS.ACTIVE_QUERIES.REPORT_EXECUTION_STATUS` remains available and is applied in addition to the mode.
  * Updated `MONITOR` privileges granted to Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent roles to ensure visibility into all queries.
* **Users**: Added multiple monitoring modes: `DIRECT_ROLES`, `ALL_ROLES`, and `ALL_PRIVILEGES`. See the "Users Plugin" section for more details.
* **Query History**: Improved performance by accelerating the process of granting Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent the necessary permissions to monitor all warehouses.

#### Added in 0.8.2

* **Communication Failure Handling**: Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent now aborts execution upon persistent communication issues. A task status BizEvent is sent with `dsoa.task.exec.status` set to `FAILED`, including details of the last failed connection attempt.

#### Fixed in 0.8.2

* **Teardown Process**: Correctly tears down tagged instances.
* **Span Event Reporting**: Removed the hard limit of 128 span events. The limit is now configurable via `OTEL.SPANS.MAX_EVENT_COUNT`.
* **Spans for Queries**: Fixed the problem with a hierarchy of query calls not being represented by a hierarchy of spans (*0.8.2 Hotfix 1*).
* **Self-Monitoring Configuration**: Plugin default configurations no longer overwrite self-monitoring settings.
* **Self-Monitoring BizEvents**: BizEvents are now sent by default when Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is deployed and executed.

### Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent 0.8.1

Released on Mar 24, 2025.

#### Breaking Changes in 0.8.1

* **Active Queries**: The plugin no longer reports a summary of query statuses since the last run. By default, only queries with `snowflake.query.execution_status` set to `RUNNING` are reported.
* **Event Log**: Entries are now reported as OTEL logs instead of events.
* **Attribute Name Changes**: Corrected typos in attribute names: `authentication.factor.first`, `authentication.factor.second`, `snowflake.task.run.scheduled_from`.

#### New Plugins in 0.8.1

* **Data Schema**: Enables monitoring of data schema changes. Reports on objects (tables, schemas, databases) modified by DDL queries.

#### Plugins Updated in 0.8.1

* **Active Queries**: Improved performance by reporting only RUNNING queries.
* **Resource Monitors**: Added `snowflake.warehouse.is_unmonitored` attribute. Log entries marked as `WARNING` for warehouses missing resource monitors and `ERROR` for accounts missing global resource monitors.
* **Event Log**: Metric entries are now reported as Dynatrace metrics, and traces/spans as OTEL traces/spans, reusing `trace_id` and `span_id` generated by Snowflake.
* **Event Log**: Old entries are cleaned up based on their timestamp compared to the `PLUGINS.EVENT_LOG.RETENTION_HOURS` configuration option.
* **Trust Center**: Sends all information as logs and metrics, and only critical findings as problem events.

#### Added in 0.8.1

* **Documentation**: Includes complete chapters on Data Platform Observability and Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent architecture.
* **Bill of Materials**: Lists Snowflake objects delivered and referenced by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent.
* **New Attribute**: `deployment.environment.tag` helps identify Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent instances by `CORE.TAG` value.

#### Improved in 0.8.1

* **Code Quality**: Multiple improvements, including automated code quality checks and using YAML format for semantic dictionary `instruments-def` files.
* **Telemetry**: `dsoa.task.exec.id` is now shared among all telemetry sent in a given run of the plugin, even if different types of objects are being sent.
* **Documentation**: Improved clarity on how each plugin sends telemetry data, specifying what is sent as logs, spans, events, bizevents, or metrics.

#### Fixed in 0.8.1

* **Active Queries**: Long-running queries are reported each time the plugin executes. If a query remains `RUNNING` for an hour, it will be reported 5 times with the default 10-minute interval.
* **Query History**: Now reports queries executed by external tasks or those without `snowflake.query.parent_id` in the `QUERY_HISTORY` view.
* **Trust Center**: Correctly reports `status.message` after changes to the content of `SCANNER_NAME` in `TRUST_CENTER.FINDINGS`.

## Contributing

This document is intended for the developers wishing to contribute to Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent.

**IMPORTANT** before you contribute with a new plugin or make changes in the existing one, make sure you understand and follow the semantic conventions for naming dimensions, attributes, and metrics.

### Semantic conventions

#### Field and metric naming rules

The following rules apply to naming fields (dimensions, attributes, and metrics) for telemetry generated by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent:

1. Use existing OpenTelemetry or Dynatrace semantics if they express the same field.
1. Custom fields SHOULD start with `snowflake.`
1. ALWAYS use lower-case + `snake_case` for naming.
1. AVOID using measurement units in names; NEVER use them at the end of the field name.
1. DO NOT provide dimensionality information in field name
1. DO NOT produce different names of the same metric depending on the dimension set; this is no longer necessary in 3rd Gen.
1. DO NOT add extension name or technology as part of field name.
1. DO NOT use `.count` suffix.
1. Boolean metrics should have `is_` or `has_` prefix.
1. Use singular and plural properly to reflect the field content.
1. Split with DOT `.` when we can identify a (virtual) object along the field name path.
1. Avoid reporting OBJECT fields returned by Snowflake directly; this can cause objects to be expanded in an uncontrolled fashion. Instead, expand object within the view and describe semantics for those expanded fields.

#### Snowflake stored procedure, table, and view creation rules

These rules apply to making Snowflake stored procedures and temporary tables as part of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent.

1. Avoid returning boolean values from Snowflake stored procedures. Instead make them more descriptive e.g. by specifying affected tables.
1. Avoid using `create or replace table` in stored procedures by initializing tables before them and truncating them in the procedure.
1. Grant at least `select` to `DTAGENT_VIEWER` and `ownership` to `DTAGENT_ADMIN` on tables. Granting table ownership should be done as `ACCOUNTADMIN` to make sure it is executed correctly.
1. Create procedures as `DTAGENT_ADMIN` and execute them as `caller` if possible.
1. Grant procedure usage to `DTAGENT_VIEWER`.
1. Include [exception statements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/snowflake-scripting/exception).
1. For views reported as logs to DT tenant, it is good practice to include `_MESSAGE` column, as it will be automatically mapped to `content` field in logs, otherwise `content` will be set to `context_name` when using `Plugin::_log_entries()`.
1. When naming and referring to objects within the `DTAGENT_DB` make sure that they are called with all uppercase (not `dtagent_db.app...`) names. Lowercase names will not be caught and renamed when deployed with a custom tag - which will cause objects to initialize in the default `DTAGENT_DB` instead of the desired, tagged one.

#### On metric types

There are 3 types of metrics defined in [OpenTelemetry Metrics API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/api/#counter):

* `counters`: something that we can keep on adding up
* `gauge`: something that gives a number with which we donâ€™t do sum/avg etc
* `histograms`: something that we plan to sum/avg etc, so basically everything else ...

**IMPORTANT:** However, since Dynatrace API only recognizes `counters` and `gauges`, and there are no examples so far of `counter` metrics,
all metrics are sent as `gauge` until further improvements in the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent code.

### Source code overview

The source code of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is organized into several types of files:

1. **Python sources**: These are compiled into the final Snowpark code for the core stored procedures (`DTAGENT()` and `SEND_TELEMETRY()`).

1. **SQL scripts**: Used to initialize Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent and create necessary objects, including views, procedures, and tasks. These scripts are located in `*.sql` folders. The best practice is to prefix all SQL files with three-digit numbers to enforce the proper order of execution. Following prefixes are "reserved" for special type of SQL scripts:

    * `0xx` for core Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent initialization, plus plugin specific procedures, views, and other scripts necessary for their execution,
    * `70x` for core procedures,
    * `80x` for task definitions, and
    * `90x` for plugin-specific update procedures.

1. **Configuration files**: Defined for the core and telemetry API, and separately for each plugin. These are located in `*.conf` folders.

1. **Documentation files**: Each part of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent and each plugin has documentation in `info.md` files, located in `*.conf` folders.

1. **Semantic Dictionary files**: Defined in `instruments-def.yml` files, located in `*.conf` folders.

#### Core code

The core of Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent code is located in the following folders:

* `src/dtagent` contains the Python files,
* `src/dtagent.conf` includes default configuration, documentation, and core semantic dictionary entries, and
* `src/dtagent.sql` contains SQL files used to initialize [Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent base objects](#dynatrace-snowflake-observability-agent-objects-in-snowflake).

#### Internal telemetry API code

The telemetry API Python code is located in the **`src/dtagent/otel`** package, with default configuration is in `src/dtagent.conf/otel-config.json`.

#### Plugin code

Each plugin consists of:

* a single Python file (`$plugin_name.py`),
* a `$plugin_name.sql` folder with definition of views, temporary tables, and helper procedures, and
* a `$plugin_name.conf` folder with configuration, semantic dictionary, and plugin documentation.

These are located in the **`src/dtagent/plugins`** directory.

#### Bash scripts

Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent comes with a number of bash scripts used to support development (see [Working with Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent source code](#working-with-dynatrace-snowflake-observability-agent-source-code) for details):

* `./compile.sh` compiles Python code into Snowpark code,
* `./build.sh` builds Snowpark code into SQL scripts,
* `./build_docs.sh` rebuilds documentation, including PDF documents,
* `./package.sh` prepares Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent for distribution,
* `./test.sh` runs a single plugin test,
* `./test_core.sh` runs a test in Jenkins context,

and deployment (also delivered in distribution package):

* `./deploy.sh` used to deploy Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent,
* `./setup.sh` ensures all prerequisites for deploying Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent are met,
* `./install_snow_cli.sh` installs Snowflake CLI,
* `./prepare_deploy_script.sh` generates a single deployment SQL script,
* `./prepare_config.sh` prepares single configuration document for uploading to Snowflake,
* `./prepare_configuration_ingest.sh` prepares SQL script that will update configuration,
* `./prepare_instruments_ingest.sh` prepares SQL script that will update semantic dictionary,
* `./update_secret.sh` is called to setup Dynatrace token as API Key,
* `./refactor_field_names.sh` call to update names of fields in your DQL code,
* `./send_event.sh` is called to send bizevents to Dynatrace to indicate when deployment starts and finishes.

### Working with Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent source code

The following figure illustrates all the steps to build code ready to be deployed, build the documentation, and finally prepare the distribution package.

![step by step Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent build process](src/assets/dsoa-build-steps.jpg)

The build process for the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent package involves several steps:

1. **Compilation**: The `compile.sh` script is used to create `_version.py` and complete Python code for both main stored procedures, resulting in a single file for each (`_dtagent.py` and `_send_telemetry.py`). The `##INSERT` directive is used to control the order in which source Python files are assembled into the main one. **NOTE**: When Snowflake reports issues in those stored procedures, the lines in the Python code will correspond to the lines in these two files.
1. **Building and embedding**: The `build.sh` script creates a single default configuration file (`build/config-default.json`) and a semantic dictionary file (`build/instruments-def.json`). It also copies over all SQL files from all `*.sql` folders. During the build process, the compiled Python files are embedded into the templates for the `APP.DTAGENT(sources array)` and `APP.SEND_TELEMETRY(sources variant, params object)` procedures respectively. The corresponding SQL files reference precompiled Python code to be embedded with the `##INSERT` directive.
1. **Documentation Update**: The `build_doc.sh` script ensures that the documentation in `#dynatrace-snowflake-observability-agent` and PDF files is up to date, including all changes to the default configuration and semantic dictionary definition.
1. **Packaging**: The `package.sh` script copies all files intended for delivery into a separate folder (`package`), which is eventually zipped into an archive with the version and build number in the name.

### Setting up development environment

You will need [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/) or newer and [git](https://git-scm.com/).
If you are on Windows, you will need to install WSL2. Please refer to the `Prerequisites` in [the installation documentation](#how-to-install) for more details.

The recommended setup is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Snowflake plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snowflake.snowflake-vsc). Though neither of those are necessary, and any IDE that supports python and SQL should do.
On Windows, after installing WSL, it is necessary to open your IDE of choice using WSL (see [Setting up WSL on VS Code guide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).

### Building Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent

If you checked out sources from git, once the environment is set up, before you can deploy your changes to Snowflake or package your release for someone else to deploy it, you need to run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

The build process ensures all SQL and JSON files are ready to be deployed by starting with the invocation of `./compile.sh`, which creates a single Python script for the main Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent procedure (`./build/_dtagent.py`) and the telemetry sender procedure (`./build/telemetry.py`). During the build, these Python files are embedded into the templates for the `APP.DTAGENT(sources array)` and `APP.SEND_TELEMETRY(sources variant, params object)` procedures, respectively.". Other source files, including configuration and semantic dictionary, are also copied into the `./build` directory.

After successfully compiling and building the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, you need to deploy it using the `./deploy.sh` command (see [installation documentation for more details](#how-to-install)).

### Updating documentation

If you have made any changes to the documentation files (`info.md`), configuration files (`*.conf/*-config.json`), semantic dictionary files (`*.conf/instruments-def.yml`), added a new plugin, or simply want to refresh the documentation, you need to run:

```bash
./build_docs.sh
```

This command will rebuild Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent and refresh `#dynatrace-snowflake-observability-agent`, plus it will deliver `Dynatrace-Snowflake-Observability-Agent-$VERSION.pdf`.

If the build process fails to run, you might need to install the following packages:

```bash
## on macOS
brew install pango cairo gdk-pixbuf libffi
## on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev
```

In some cases, you may need to also set up `WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES`:

```bash
## on macOS
export WEASYPRINT_DLL_DIRECTORIES=/opt/homebrew/lib
```

### Packaging Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent for distribution

In case we want to share Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent with other users, we can call:

```bash
./package.sh
```

This will prepare a distribution package called `dynatrace_snowflake_observability_agent-$VERSION.$BUILD.zip`. The package will contain everything that is necessary to distribute Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent.

### Testing Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent locally

After successfully deploying the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent, you can run tests using:

```bash
./test.sh $test_name
```

All tests are implemented with the `pytest` framework and stored in the `test` folder. Before running the tests, make sure to create the `test/credentials.json` file from the `test/credentials.jsonc` template.

Parameter `$test_name` is required and needs to be the name of the file - excluding the extension - from the `/test/plugins` directory that you want to run. The test files follow the naming pattern `/test/plugins/test_*.py`.

To test a single plugin, you can call:

```bash
./test.sh test_$plugin_name
```

If you want to (re)initialize the test data, you need to run:

```bash
./test.sh test_$plugin_name -p
```

The SQL files stored in the `test` folder can be used to run some additional tests manually.

## Appendix A: Migrating semantics from version 0.7 to 0.8

In version 0.8, the semantics of the telemetry sent by Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent underwent significant refactoring to improve compatibility with industry standards such as OpenTelemetry and the naming conventions in the Dynatrace Semantic Dictionary.
This ensures better interoperability and adherence to widely accepted practices.

To update to the new version, users need to run the `refactor_field_names.sh` script, which is included in the package.
This script requires two parameters:

1. **fields-refactoring.csv**: This file, provided in the package, contains the mapping of old field names to new field names.
2. **Exported Data Folder**: The location of the folder containing all exported dashboards, workflows, and other relevant data.

By running the script with these parameters, it will automatically update all semantics to be compatible with version 0.8.
This process ensures that all field names are correctly updated according to the new naming conventions.

Below is a table that lists all the changes made to the field names.
This table provides a clear mapping between the old names (version 0.7) and the new names (version 0.8):

## Appendix B: Migrating meta-field semantics to version 0.8.3 or higher

Version 0.8.3 aligns the naming of several meta-fields with the product's final, official name: **Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent** (formerly SnowAgent). If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.8.3, you will need to update any custom dashboards, workflows, or other assets that rely on these fields.

The refactoring process is similar to the one described in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-sec) and uses the same `refactor_field_names.sh` script.
However, for this migration, you must use the `dsoa-fields-refactoring.csv` file, which contains the specific mappings for these meta-field updates.

The table below lists the changes, showing the mapping from the old names to the new names used in version 0.8.3 and onwards.

### Meta-Field Name Mapping
