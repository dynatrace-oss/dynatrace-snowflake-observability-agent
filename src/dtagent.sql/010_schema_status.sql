-- This way we can keep track when each type of measurements (like query_history, log_events, ...) took place (PROCESS_TIME), 
-- and until which moment the measurements were collected and sent to DT
-- for query_history this is purely informational (as detailed information is in PROCESSED_QUERIES_* tables)
