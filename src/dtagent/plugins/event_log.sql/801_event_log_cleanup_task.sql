--  This task ensures Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent is called periodically
--
use role DTAGENT_ADMIN; use database DTAGENT_DB; use warehouse DTAGENT_WH;  

-- IMPORTANT: this task is executed as DTAGENT_ADMIN, so it can alter EVENT_LOG table
-- we wanted to run this task after TASK_DTAGENT_EVENT_LOG to ensure data is cleaned
-- but according to Snowflake documentation: 
--  "All tasks in a task graph must have the same task owner. A single role must have the OWNERSHIP privilege on all of the tasks in the task graph."
