This plugin enables monitoring of Snowflake budgets, resources linked to them, and their expenditures. It sets up and manages the Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent's own budget.

All budgets within the account are reported on as logs and metrics; this includes their details, spending limit, and recent expenditures.
The plugin runs once a day and excludes already reported expenditures.
