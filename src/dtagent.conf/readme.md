**Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent** is a powerful tool designed to enhance [Data Platform Observability](DPO.md) within the Snowflake environment. It complements Dynatrace's capabilities by [extending observability](PLUGINS.md) into areas where traditional OneAgent or synthetic monitoring may not reach. Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent provides [comprehensive telemetry](SEMANTICS.md) for monitoring, analyzing, and detecting anomalies in data processing. It delivers observability data in the form of OpenTelemetry [logs](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-logs) and [spans](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-tracesspans), as well as Dynatrace [metrics](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-metrics), [events](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-events), and [business events (CloudEvents)](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-bizevents), ensuring a seamless integration with Dynatrace's observability platform.
