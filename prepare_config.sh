# Converts configuration in a form of a dictionary, just like in config/config-template.json
#     In order to properly load the data into table with 3 columns (path, value, type) we need to flatten the json to one level of nesting.
#     This will allow for inputting json key as context, nested json key as key and nested json value as value into CONFIG.CONFIGURATIONS.
#     To get the desired values of keys from the structure of the config json, we need to combine some of the keys into one.
#     So we use stack to iterate over each key and prepare the combined key.
# Args:
#     config_data (dict): Configuration dictionary
# Returns:
#     list: configuration flattened into a list of three-column objects to make it easier to load into Snowflake
